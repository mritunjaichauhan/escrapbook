              Another year, another birthday‚Äîand even though you&apos;re far away, what I feel most today is how lucky I am to have you as my brother.

              To me, you&apos;ve always been more than just a brother. You were my anchor, my guide, and often my voice when I couldn&apos;t speak for myself. I still remember how you&apos;d step in with Mumma and Papa, making sense of things I couldn&apos;t explain. From you, I&apos;ve learned what real support and quiet strength look like. And I want you to know‚Äîyou can always lean on me, just like I leaned on you.

              Birthdays always bring back memories. I think of those calls you made from college, how they kept us close even when you were away. And of course, I remember our Hot Wheels matches‚Äîhow serious we made them, and how the loser had to dance to Gangnam Style. Those moments are still some of my favorites, and they always make me smile.

              These memories remind me of the bond we share, one that no distance can ever weaken. I miss you, and I&apos;m already looking forward to the day you&apos;re home so we can make new memories together.
